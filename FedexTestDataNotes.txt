Didnt really need the zip codes for carrier and recipient when you already have city and state

Deleted the package facts that were unnecessary like the weight 

I would have liked the order date

Change the dates to just dates not the time

Change the time from military time to standard time by formatting the cells 

Expected delivery time and actual delivery time have have wrong dates that's odd with the times of 1901 as the year so I will ask more questions about the data
-- I wanted to change the expected delivery time and actual delivery time but the dates on them are wrong dated back to 1901
-- but if they were right I would down the time elapsed for the faster service types like next day, two day, and three day service types  

-- I would have liked to have the order dates so I can compare the service types to when the order was placed to the expected and actual dates and times to be delivered

Just Wanted to keep in mind customer satisfaction and money



-- These are the types of charges given in this dataset

-- First I would talk about the residential delivery indicator 
-- I would change that data type to a decimal and give the percentage of each type given (R,U,C) and make that a charge because i should go into the shipper cost
-- Next I would look into the generic zone ill keep the zone but add the exact mileage per shipment so it can be accounted for with the other charges
-- Next I would like to know what goes into the asccessorial and fuel charges because based on this sample thats where 
-- I would make my money at increasing these charges and keeping freight charges or rates the same for the type of service

     
Select Generic_Service_Type, Total_Closed_Charge_Amount, Total_Closed_Credit_Amount, Base_Freight_Charges, Fuel_Charges, Accessorial_Charges, Generic_Zone, Residential_Delivery_Indicator
From Portfolio..FedExTestData

-- Then Ill break down the service type and all of the charges made 
-- and see who uses what service more and tell the customer to charge more accordingly

--- Top 3 states that you ship from
--- TX GA CA
-- I would start to look into the top states that ship the most products along with the corresponding cities 
-- and compare greatest to least shipping state and city then deep dive into the cost along with the envionment of the city and state.
